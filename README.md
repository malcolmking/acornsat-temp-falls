# acornsat-temp-falls
Code repository for ACORN-SAT temperature fall analysis paper

There are four python notebooks that generate one figure in the paper each:
* acorn_objfront_comparison.ipynb: compares ACORN-SAT temperature falls to objective fronts generated through the pyfronts module, and generates Fig 1 of the paper.
* acorn_station_clusterplot.ipynb: applies a hierachical clustering method to the ACORN-SAT stations, and generates figure 2 of the paper.
* acorn_analysis_10K.ipynb: plots 10k temperature falls at 9 stations from the ACORN-SAT data, generating figure 3 of the paper.
* acorn_climate_pattern_plots.ipynb: compares the frequency of 10K temperature drops for different phases of ENSO, IOD, and SAM, and generates Fig 4 of the paper.

This repo may have some small updates post-submission of the paper to ensure all ancillarily files needed to reach the conclusions of the paper are included, and that the files can be easily run, but will be locked soon afterwards.
